Port of OSQP embedded Quadratic Program (QP) solver for ESP32. 

> A code generation software package that accepts a parametric description of a quadratic program (QP) as input and generates tailored C code that compiles into a fast and reliable optimization solver for the QP that can run on embedded platforms.

## Use Cases
- Model Predictive Controll (MPC)
- Robust Least-Squares
- Constrained Least-Squares
- Sparse Linear Regression
- Portfolio Optimization
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Getting Started

See the [examples](examples) directory.
